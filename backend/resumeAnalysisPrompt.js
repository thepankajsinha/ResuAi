{
  "summary": "A short 2â€“3 sentence professional summary inferred from the resume.",
  "ats_score": number,  // ATS score out of 10
  "ats_reasons": ["List of key reasons behind the ATS score (both positive and negative)"],
  "strengths": ["Top strengths based on resume content"],
  "weaknesses": ["Main weaknesses or missing elements"],
  "suggestions": {
    "high": ["High-impact, actionable improvements"],
    "medium": ["Moderate-impact improvements"],
    "optional": ["Minor or optional enhancements"]
  }
}

Guidelines:
1. Base your evaluation only on the given resume text.
2. Estimate ATS score out of 10 (0 = poor, 10 = excellent) and provide short reasons.
3. Keep summary factual and professional (no assumptions beyond resume evidence).
4. Suggestions should be specific, clear, and prioritized into high, medium, and optional impact.
5. If data is missing (e.g., education, contact info), mention it in weaknesses or suggestions.
